  Choose the algorithm for extracting keypoints and computing descriptors. . Default: ``dspsift``

:ref:`force-gps<force-gps>` 
  Use images' GPS exif data for reconstruction, even if there are GCPs present.This flag is useful if you have high precision GPS measurements. If there are no GCPs, this flag does nothing. Default: ``False``

:ref:`gcp<gcp>` <path string>
  Path to the file containing the ground control points used for georeferencing. The file needs to use the following format: EPSG:<code> or <+proj definition>geo_x geo_y geo_z im_x im_y image_name [gcp_name] [extra1] [extra2]Default: ``None``

  Set a value in meters for the GPS Dilution of Precision (DOP) information for all images. If your images are tagged with high precision GPS information (RTK), this value will be automatically set accordingly. You can use this option to manually set it in case the reconstruction fails. Lowering this option can sometimes help control bowling-effects over large areas. Default: ``3``

:ref:`help<help>` 
  show this help message and exit

:ref:`ignore-gsd<ignore-gsd>` 
  Ignore Ground Sampling Distance (GSD).A memory and processor hungry change relative to the default behavior if set to true. Ordinarily, GSD estimates are used to cap the maximum resolution of image outputs and resizes images when necessary, resulting in faster processing and lower memory usage. Since GSD is an estimate, sometimes ignoring it can result in slightly better image output quality. Never set --ignore-gsd to true unless you are positive you need it, and even then: do not use it. Default: ``False``

:ref:`matcher-neighbors<matcher-neighbors>` <positive integer>
  Perform image matching with the nearest images based on GPS exif data. Set to 0 to match by triangulation. Default: ``0``

:ref:`min-num-features<min-num-features>` <integer>

:ref:`pc-rectify<pc-rectify>` 
  Perform ground rectification on the point cloud. This means that wrongly classified ground points will be re-classified and gaps will be filled. Useful for generating DTMs. Default: ``False``

:ref:`pc-sample<pc-sample>` <positive float>
  Filters the point cloud by keeping only a single point around a radius N (in meters). This can be useful to limit the output resolution of the point cloud and remove duplicate points. Set to 0 to disable sampling. Default: ``0``
